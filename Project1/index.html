<h1 style ="text-align: center">Iceland</h1>
<p><em><strong>Iceland</strong></em> is a country of sharp contrasts.  A place where fire and ice co-exists.
    Where dark winters are offset by the summer's midnight sun. A country where 
    insular existence has spurred a rich and vibrant culture.</p>

        <p>The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas. From september to april, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow.
        <br>The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights is a natural phenomenon created when particles emitted by the sun interact with the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic field. This releases energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks across the skies.

        <p> When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention
            to the country's namesake—namely, its 4,500 square miles of glacier. 
            Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year-round and takes place mainly 
            on the Sólheimajökull and Svínafellsjökull glaciers in the south of Iceland, 
            to which day trips are offered from Reykjavík (and Skaftafell). </p>

    <p>
        There are two teams, Nets and Knicks. They compete against each other 3 times. The team with the highest average
        score wins a trophy! Your tasks: <br><br>
        1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below <br><br>
        2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, and print it to the
        console.Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that as well (draw means they have the same average
        score) <br><br>
        3. Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a team only wins if it has a
        higher score than the other team, and the same time a score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator
        to test for
        minimum score, as well as multiple else-if blocks.<br><br>

        4. Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when both teams have the same score and
        both have a score greater or equal 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy. <br><br>

        Test data: *Data 1: Nets score 96, 108 and 89. Knicks score 88, 91 and 110 * Data Bonus 1: Nets score 97
